# How to install SNAP (the Stanford library)

1. Install dependencies
2. Download and extract SANP library
3. Replace the "glib-core/bd.h" with the version from this repo
4. Make sure you are in the snap directory and run "make all"
5. Navigate to the tutorials directory and run "make all" as well to make sure it works

P.S. There will be a lot of warnings on the screen when compiling it, as long as there are no errors, it should be fine.

# And now SNAP should work :)
